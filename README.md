# Smart Parking System for Computer Science Final Year Project at MUST by Siemba Ernest Ooko
This repository is created purposely for my final year computer science project. This system uses technologies like Google Maps to provide real-time navigation. There are two types of users of this system; drivers and park owners. The park owners post their parking lots on Google Maps, and the drivers are able to view them on their interface. The drivers can book or reserve parking, they can pay parking fee.
